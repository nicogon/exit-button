# Google meet exit button

![Demo](demo.gif)

Files for building your own Single-button "keyboard" to leave any google meetings with violence. (And also lock your computer with a longer press)

## What it is
- A single-switch mechanical keyboard a large 3D-printed keycap (panic mushroom lookalike)
- Powered by a attiny85 microcontroller
- A single push would send CMD + W (close tab command) to exit a google meeting
- A longer push would lock your computer by sending  the combination ALT + CMD + POWER


## What it included
- 3d models: Base and button
- Arduino code to simulate a keyboard

## What I need
- A digispark attiny85
- 3d printer
- A computer switch [Cherry mx standard] (from an interchangeable mechanical keyboard). I used the black one (the hardest I had) 
- some cables
